# Ford Power-Up Version History

The version history of the Ford Power-Up updates for the Ford SYNC Version 4 and 4a hardware developed by Ford Motor Company began with the release of the 2021 Mustang Mach-E in December 2020. This was simply referred to as over-the-air updates until May 2021 when Ford adopted the "Ford Power-Up" name.

## Overview

The Ford Power-Up updates have the ability to upgrade the user interface as well as reprogram module firmware within the vehicle. Ford expects to produce 33 million vehicles with Power-Up capability by 2028. Not all vehicles have the same software layout due to the differences in the user interfaces. SYNC 4 comes with an 8 or 12 inch horizontally oriented main display while SYNC 4a comes with a 12 or 15.5 inch vertically oriented main display.

## BlueCruise

The current version of BlueCruise is v1.3, [announced by Ford on July 13, 2023](https://www.at.ford.com/us/en/home/news-media/news/2023/7/blue-cruise-1-3-rollout.html).  Mustang Mach-E customers with model years 2021-2023 equipped with BlueCruise can receive the update to BlueCruise 1.3 via a Ford Power-Up software update once it starts to roll out in summer 2023.  (*Note:* vehicles equipped with BlueCruise 1.0 will be updated straight to BlueCruise 1.3, which includes all features of BlueCruise 1.2.)  Customers who placed an order after May 2, 2023, or the vehicle was produced after June 30, 2023, your Mustang Mach-E will be delivered from the factory with BlueCruise 1.3.

- BlueCruise v1.2 features:
  - Lane Change Assist (change lanes with a tap of the turn signal)
  - Predictive Speed Assist (adjust vehicle speed for road curves, roundabouts and more)
  - In-Lane Repositioning (helps hands-free highway driving feel more natural by keeping the vehicle in its lane while subtly shifting its position away from vehicles in adjacent lanes, especially large semi trucks)
- BlueCruise v1.3 features:
  - Fewer disengagements through curves and narrow lanes

- Charge Assist (rollout beginning September 2023)
  - Find, start, and pay for public charging stations from inside the vehicle wihtout having to use a phone app
  - In-vehicle display shows cost per kWh, estimate time to 80% SoC, and charger availability
